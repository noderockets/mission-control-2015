It's an awesome video. Definitely go watch it. He mentions creating a game by doing a piece, then passing it off to a friend, then repeating.

## Prereqs

- Install Node 0.12 or io.js 1.x (I recommend you use nvm)
- Install Flow 0.6.0 (using brew)

## Install it

- `npm i`

## Hack on it

- `npm start`

## Notes

This project uses eslint and flow. I'd highly recommend getting editor plugins if your editor supports it. Alternatively, you can always run `npm test` to see the status of the project.
